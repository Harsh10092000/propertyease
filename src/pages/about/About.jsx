              <h2>About Us</h2>
              <p>
                Propertyease.in is a registered website founded in 2023, with
                the sole mission and objective of simplifying the transparent
                process of selling and buying property. Our purpose is to start
                this website to minimize the gap between seller and buyer and
                provide them convenience in their choice to decide about the
                property. For sellers, we find out the potential buyers from
                their properties and also offer them to list their property for
                free on a website and also offer them to set up a 3D View or
                virtual tour of their property.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, We help buyers to search out a list of properties on a
                website or also to show them the first 3DView or virtual tours
                of the property before visiting sellers, which helps them to
                minimize the cost. And once they like the virtual tour of the
                property, then we arrange the physical meeting with the sellers.
