                  <h2>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h2>
                  <p>
                  At PropertyEase, we are committed to providing you with an exceptional property experience. If you need to cancel any services or request a refund, weâ€™ve outlined our policy below to ensure transparency and clarity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                <b>1. Property Booking or Reservation Cancellation </b>
              </p>
                  <p>
                  Cancellation Requests: You may cancel a property booking or reservation by contacting our customer service team at least 48 hours prior to the scheduled viewing, signing, or any other service. Cancellations made after this period may be subject to charges.
                  </p>
                  <p>Refunds for Cancellations: If you cancel within the allowed timeframe, a full refund will be issued to the original payment method. Please note that the processing time for refunds may vary based on your payment method.</p>
                  <p>
                <b>2. Service Cancellation (Construction or Property-Related Services) </b>
              </p>
                  <p>
                  Cancellation: If you wish to cancel a property construction project or any related services, please notify us at least 7 days before the service is set to begin. For cancellations made after this period, a non-refundable deposit may apply to cover administrative and preparatory costs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Refund: Refund eligibility for these services will be assessed based on the stage of the project or service. Refunds will only be granted if work or services have not yet commenced.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                <b>3. Rent/Lease Agreements Cancellation </b>
              </p>
                  <p>
                  Cancellation by Tenant: If you wish to cancel a rental agreement or lease, you must notify us 30 days in advance of your intended move-out date. Rent paid in advance will be refunded according to the lease agreement, and conditions may apply.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Cancellation by Landlord: If a lease is canceled by the landlord, the tenant will be refunded based on the unexpired portion of the rental period. Refunds will be processed as per the terms outlined in the lease agreement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                <b>4. Refunds for Property Purchases or Sales </b>
              </p>
                  <p>
                  Refund Policy: Once a sale agreement has been finalized and signed, cancellations and refunds are typically not possible unless specified by legal terms or mutual agreement. In case of issues arising with the transaction, we will do our best to mediate and offer appropriate solutions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Deposit Refunds: Any refundable deposits made toward property purchases or sales may be refunded, provided the cancellation request is made in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                <b>5.  Special Circumstances </b>
              </p>

              <p>
              In case of special circumstances (such as natural disasters or emergencies), we will review the cancellation and refund request on a case-by-case basis. Our goal is to ensure fairness, and we will work with you to resolve any concerns.
